    "# Creating data with web APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people who think they want to do web scraping actually want to pull data down from site-supplied APIs. Using an API is better in almost every way, and really the only reason to scrape data is if:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The website was constructed in the 90s and does not have an API; or,\n",
    "2. You are doing something illegal\n",
    "\n",
    "If [LiveJournal has an API](http://dev.livejournal.com/), the website you are interested in probably does too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "**API** is shorthand for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface, which is in turn computer-ese for a middleman.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it this way. You have a bunch of things on your computer that you want other people to be able to look at. Some of them are static documents, some of them call programs in real time, and some of them are programs themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution 1\n",
    "\n",
    "You publish login credentials on the internet, and let anyone log into your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. People will need to know how each document and program works to be able to access their data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You don't want the world looking at your browser history\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution 2\n",
    "\n",
    "You paste everything into HTML and publish it on the internet\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This can be information overload\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Making things dynamic can be tricky\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution 3\n",
    "\n",
    "You create a set of methods to act as an intermediary between the people you want to help and the things you want them to have access to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this is the best solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. People only access what you want them to have, in the way that you want them to have it\n",
    "\n",
    "2. People use one language to get the things they want\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this is still not Panglossian:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will have to explain to people how to use your middleman\n"

    "## Twitter's API\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter has an API - mostly written for third-party apps - that is comparatively straightforward and gives you access to _nearly_ all of the information that Twitter has about its users, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User histories\n",
    "\n",
    "2. User (and tweet) location\n",
    "\n",
    "3. User language\n",

    "4. Tweet popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Tweet spread\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Conversation chains\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Twitter returns data to you in json, or **J**ava **S**cript **O**bject **N**otation. This is a very common format for passing data around http connections for browsers and servers, so many APIs return it as a datatype as well (instead of using something like xml or plain text).\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, json converts into native Python data structures. Specifically, every json object you get from Twitter will be a combination of nested `dicts` and `lists`, which you learned about yesterday. This makes Twitter a lot easier to manipulate in Python than html objects, for example.\n",

In Twitter, different levels of authorization require different levels of authentication. \n",
