Search engines use these crawlers to continually traverse the web and index new or changed content, so that our search queries reflect the most recent and up-to-date content. \n",

    "Web scraping is a little different. While many of the tools used may be identical or similar, web scraping \"focuses more on the transformation of unstructured data on the web, typically in HTML format, into structured data that can be stored and analyzed in a central local database or spreadsheet.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) In other words, web scraping focuses on translating data into a form ready for storage and analysis (versus just indexing). \n",

    "Their policies and responses differ with respect to these two areas. You'll need to do some research to determine what is appropriate with regards to your research. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Keeping their website up\n",
    "Most commercial websites have strategies to throttle or block IPs that make too many requests within a fixed amount of time. Because a bot can make a large number of requests in a small amount of time (etc. entering 100 different terms into Google in one second), servers are able to determine if traffic is coming from a bot or a person (among many other methods). For companies that rely on advertising, like Google or Twitter, these requests do not represent \"human eyeballs\" and need to be filtered out from their bill to advertisers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to keep their site up and running, companies may block your IP temporarily or permanently if they detect too many requests coming from your IP, or other signs that requests are being made by a bot instead of a person. If you systematically down a site (such as sending millions of requests to an official government site), there is the small chance your actions may be interpreted maliciously (and regarded as hacking), with risk of prosecution. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Protecting the commercial value of their data\n",
    "Companies are also typically very protective of their data, especially data that ties directly into how they make money. A listings site (like Craigslist), for instance, would lose traffic if listings on its site were poached and transfered to a competitor, or if a rival company used scraping tools to derive lists of users to contact. For this reason, companies' term of use agreements are typically very restrictive of what you can do with their data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different companies may have a range of responses to your scraping, depending on what you do with the data. Typically, repurposing the data for a rival application or business will trigger a strong response from the company (i.e. legal attention).

    "\n",
    "Our first use case involves scraping some basic information about technology companies from Wikipedia. Say you are the chief innovation officer of a small city in the San Francisco Bay Area. A number of large-scale local investments in office space have taken place, with space opening up over the next few years. You wish to be part of the trend of technology companies moving out of San Francisco and Silicon Valley. You have been networking and talking to companies at events and conferences, but would like a more systematic way of identifying companies to focus on. \n",

    "** In particular, you want to know: **  \n",
    "1) what industry they are in  \n",
    "2) where the company is currently headquartered  \n",
    "3) the number of employees   \n",
    "4) website address of the company  \n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow you to know the current and budding tech hubs in the Bay area, get a better sense of your competition, and the number of jobs you can attract to your city. For convenience, you also collate the website addresses of the companies to pull into your list. "

    "\n",
    "Most people who think they want to do web scraping actually want to pull data down from site-supplied APIs. Using an API is better in almost every way, and really the only reason to scrape data is if:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The website was constructed in the 90s and does not have an API; or,\n",
    "2. You are doing something illegal\n",
    "\n",
    "If [LiveJournal has an API](http://dev.livejournal.com/), the website you are interested in probably does too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "**API** is shorthand for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface, which is in turn computer-ese for a middleman.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it this way. You have a bunch of things on your computer that you want other people to be able to look at. Some of them are static documents, some of them call programs in real time, and some of them are programs themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution 1\n",
    "\n",
    "You publish login credentials on the internet, and let anyone log into your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. People will need to know how each document and program works to be able to access their data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You don't want the world looking at your browser history\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution 2\n",
    "\n",
    "You paste everything into HTML and publish it on the internet\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This can be information overload\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Making things dynamic can be tricky\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution 3\n",
    "\n",
    "You create a set of methods to act as an intermediary between the people you want to help and the things you want them to have access to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this is the best solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. People only access what you want them to have, in the way that you want them to have it\n",

    "2. People use one language to get the things they want\n",
