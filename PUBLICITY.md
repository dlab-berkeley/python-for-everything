**title** : Python for Everything

**description** : This four part, interactive workshop series is your complete introduction to the capabilities of the Python language. By the end of the series, you will be able to apply your knowledge of basic principles of programming and data manipulation to collect data, process unstructured data, analyze tabular data, and automate the entire process.

## Part 0

**subtitle** : Getting started with Python

**description** : Students will be understand the motivation behind object orientation and how that relates to computation. Students will be able to use different methods of interacting with the Python interpreter, and will be able to execute basic functions in python like importing and printing. Students will understand what datatypes are, and why it matters that they have been delineated.

**knowledge requirements** : [Programming Fun!damentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/programming-fundamentals), or equivalent prior knowledge

**tech requirements** : Laptop required; please install the [Anaconda distribution of Python 3](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or its equivalent. The [Rodeo IDE](https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo) is recommended, but not required

## Part 1

**subtitle** : Understanding iteration and logical control

**description** : Students will learn how datatypes are combined into structures, and how these structures are instances of classes. Students be able to choose the correct data structure to fit a purpose, and then interact with it successfully. Students will understand the logic behind looping, and apply it to data structures. Students will be able to use python to interact with their host operating system, including reading and writing to disk, interacting with file structures, and interacting with other software.

## Part 2

**subtitle** : Using Python to create data

**description** : Students will have a basic understanding of how data is passed over networks, and what the difference is between parsing HTML (scraping) and querying an API. They will put this into practice at a low level using HTTP requests, and at a high level using a site supplied API. Students will parse structured documents with lxml. Students will be introduced to automated data retrieval and storage.

## Part 3

**subtitle** : Using Python to analyze data

**description** : Students will plan, build, and execute an analytical pipeline using both text-based, schemaless data; and numeric, tabular data. Students will learn the basics of cleaning, transforming, and formatting text data, and be able to pull simple metrics from corpora. Students will summarize and analyze tabular data.
