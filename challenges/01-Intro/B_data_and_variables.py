# your code here is evaluated by py.test test_B_data_and_variables

# instructors

## what are our names?
instructors = 'Dav and Rochelle'

# types
## Now define some other types of variables

## some_int should be an integer

## some_float should be a float

## some_bool should be... what do you think?

# redefining
## Here, I define a variable
my_lucky_number = 7

## But Dav's lucky number is 9 (and he wrote the test)
## Redefine the value "correctly" below
my_lucky_number = 9
some_int = 8

## Only the most recent variable assignment matters
print "Dav's lucky number:", my_lucky_number
